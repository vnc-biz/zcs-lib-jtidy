    <section name="What can I do with it?">
      <p>It can be used as a tool for cleaning up malformed and faulty HTML generated by your dynamic web application.
      </p>
      <p>It can Validate HTML without changing the output and generate warnings for each page so you could identify JSP or Servlet that need to be fixed.
      </p>
      <p>It can save you hours of time. The more HTML you write in JSP or Servlets, the more time you will save.
         Don't waste time manually looking for problems, figuring out why your HTML doesn't display like it should.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to JTidy validation you could submit dynamically generated pages to online HTML validators
        for example <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>,
        <a href="http://www.wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Accessibility Tool</a> or
        <a href="http://htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/">WDG HTML Validator</a> even if you are behind the firewall.
