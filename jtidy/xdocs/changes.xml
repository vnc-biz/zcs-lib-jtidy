      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Fixed a bug in the parseAttribute() method of Lexer.java which generated an incorrect
  length for the UTF8 representation of characters above \u007f.  This was causing

  line 2577.  Thanks to dlgo@users.sourceforge.net for reporting this problem.

      Fixed a bug in the insertedToken() method of Lexer.java which generated a Negative
  ArraySizeException in the clone() method of Node.java.  An ending value for a range in

  dlgo@users.sourceforge.net for reporting this problem.

      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Changed the behavior of DOMNodeImpl so that nodes added via the DOM interface have
  the correct node type.  Previously, such nodes could not contain any content because

      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Added methods to support DOM Level 2.
      </action>

  entry set to null.

      A patch by Brett Knights has been incorporated. The patch affects
