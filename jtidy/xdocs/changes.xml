      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Fixed a bug in the parseAttribute() method of Lexer.java which generated an incorrect
  length for the UTF8 representation of characters above \u007f.  This was causing
  a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in method isValidAttributeName() of Lexer.java at
  line 2577.  Thanks to dlgo@users.sourceforge.net for reporting this problem.
      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Fixed a bug in the insertedToken() method of Lexer.java which generated a Negative
  ArraySizeException in the clone() method of Node.java.  An ending value for a range in

  dlgo@users.sourceforge.net for reporting this problem.
      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">

      </action>

      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Changed the behavior of DOMNodeImpl so that nodes added via the DOM interface have
  the correct node type.  Previously, such nodes could not contain any content because
  they were added with a type of StartEndTag.
      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">
      Added methods to support DOM Level 2.
      </action>
      <action dev="" type="fix">

  entry set to null.
