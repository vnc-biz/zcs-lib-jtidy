    <section name="About JTidy">
      <p>
        JTidy is a Java port of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</a>
        , a HTML syntax checker and pretty printer. Like its non-Java cousin, JTidy can be used as a tool for cleaning up malformed and faulty HTML. In addition, JTidy provides a DOM interface to the document that is being processed, which effectively makes you able to use JTidy as a DOM parser for real-world HTML.
      </p>
      <p>JTidy was written by Andy Quick, who later stepped down from the maintainer position. Now JTidy is maintained by a group of volunteers.</p>
      <p>
        More information on JTidy can be found on the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/">JTidy SourceForge project page</a>

      <subsection name="January 8, 2004">
        <p><strong>179</strong> test cases for JTidy have been <em>partially</em> implemented and added!</p>
        <p>
        	All the test cases for the non java version of Tidy have been integrated. <em>Partially</em> because most of them
        	don't check yet output or warnings produced by Tidy, but simply test that JTidy doesn't crash or loop.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Well, actually as you can see in the <a href="junit-report.html">junit report</a> we have 1 test causing a NPE and 4 causing infinite loops!
        	These bugs will have the precedence over any incorrect output bug (fixing these will probably worth a new release, you don't
        	want your software to hang using JTidy, right?).
        </p>
        <p>
        	Anyway, in the TidyCrashingBugsTest (test that crashed the c version of Tidy) 21 of the 24 tests works without problems... not so bad as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
        	See <a href="testcases.html">testcases</a>, if you wanna help JTidy supplying tests or fixes.

      <subsection name="January 6, 2004">
        <p>JTidy new website is online!</p>
        <p>The project is starting again after two years without a release. I (Fabrizio Giustina) just joined the project as new administrator and developer.</p>
        <p>
          Main targets are now:
          <ul>
            <li>migrate to maven as a build system (done)</li>
            <li>
              old code cleanup: remove unused code, clean up everything with the help of
              <a href="checkstyle-report.html">checkstyle</a>
              and
              <a href="pmd-report.html">pmd</a>
              , and update code to use new
              <a href="coding_conventions.html">coding conventions</a>
              .
            </li>
            <li>
              add junit test coverage (started, see
              <a href="junit-report.html">junit report</a>
              and
              <a href="clover/index.html">clover report</a>
              ). I'm trying to integrate all the standard tidy testcases to check that jtidy will behave like its non-Java cousin
            </li>
            <li>Finally: integrate all the patches supplied by users in these years and the fixes in the non-Java version</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          A note about mailing lists: there are two new mailing list, specific to jtidy, see
          <a href="mail-lists.html">project mailing lists</a>
          . You can find previous discussions in
          <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy">html-tidy@w3.org</a>
          archives (common to tidy and jtidy).
