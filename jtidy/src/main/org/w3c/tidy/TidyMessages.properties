badchars_summary=Characters codes for the Microsoft Windows fonts in the range\n\
128 - 159 may not be recognized on other platforms. You are\n\
instead recommended to use named entities, e.g. &trade; rather\n\
than Windows character code 153 (0x2122 in Unicode). Note that\n\
as of February 1998 few browsers support the new entities."\n

badform_summary=You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form>\n\
tags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements\n\
are no exception. For instance you should not place the <form>\n\
in one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is\n\
placed before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the\n\
table! Note that one form can't be nested inside another!\n

badaccess_missing_summary=The table summary attribute should be used to describe\n\
the table structure. It is very helpful for people using\n\
non-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for\n\
table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply\n\
to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide\n\
a meaningful context for each cell.\n

badaccess_missing_image_alt=The alt attribute should be used to give a short description\n\
of an image; longer descriptions should be given with the\n\
longdesc attribute which takes a URL linked to the description.\n\
These measures are needed for people using non-graphical browsers.\n

badaccess_missing_image_map=Use client-side image maps in preference to server-side image\n\
maps as the latter are inaccessible to people using non-\n\
graphical browsers. In addition, client-side maps are easier\n\
to set up and provide immediate feedback to users.\n

badaccess_missing_link_alt=For hypertext links defined using a client-side image map, you\n\
need to use the alt attribute to provide a textual description\n\
of the link for people using non-graphical browsers.\n

badaccess_frames=Pages designed using frames presents problems for\n\
people who are either blind or using a browser that\n\
doesn't support frames. A frames-based page should always\n\
include an alternative layout inside a NOFRAMES element.\n

badaccess_summary=For further advice on how to make your pages accessible\n\
see "{0}". You may also want to try\n\
"http://www.cast.org/bobby/" which is a free Web-based\n\
service for checking URLs for accessibility.\n

badlayout_using_layer=The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Positioning mechanism\n\
is recommended in preference to the proprietary <LAYER>\n\
element due to limited vendor support for LAYER.\n

badlayout_using_spacer=You are recommended to use CSS for controlling white\n\
space (e.g. for indentation, margins and line spacing).\n\
The proprietary <SPACER> element has limited vendor support.\n

badlayout_using_font=You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and\n\
properties such as its size and color. This will reduce\n\
the size of HTML files and make them easier to maintain\n\
compared with using <FONT> elements.\n

badlayout_using_nobr=You are recommended to use CSS to control line wrapping.\n\
Use \"white-space: nowrap\" to inhibit wrapping in place\n\
of inserting <NOBR>...</NOBR> into the markup.\n

badlayout_using_body=You are recommended to use CSS to specify page and link colors\n

unrecognized_option=unrecognized option -{0} use -help to list options
unknown_file={0}: can''t open file "{1}"
unknown_option=Warning - unknown option: {0}
bad_argument=Warning - missing or malformed argument "{1}" for option "{0}"

needs_author_intervention=This document has errors that must be fixed before\n\
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.\n\n

missing_body=Can't create slides - document is missing a body element.
slides_found={0,number} Slides found

# to be translated
backslash_in_uri={0} URI reference contains backslash. Typo?
fixed_backslash={0} converting backslash in URI to slash
illegal_uri_reference={0} improperly escaped URI reference
escaped_illegal_uri={0} escaping malformed URI reference
newline_in_uri={0} discarding newline in URI reference
anchor_not_unique={0} Anchor "{1}" already defined
joining_attribute={0} joining values of repeated attribute "{1}"
expected_equalsign={0} unexpected '=', expected attribute name
attr_value_not_lcase={0} attribute value "{1}" for "{2}" must be lower case for XHTML
missing_quotemark={0} attribute with missing trailing quote mark
unescaped_element=unescaped {0} in pre content
apos_undefined=Named Entity &apos; only defined in XML/XHTML
nested_quotation=nested q elements, possible typo
entity_in_id=no entities allowed in id attribute, discarding "&"
repeated_attribute={0} dropping value "{1}" for repeated attribute "{2}"
element_not_empty={0} element not empty or not closed

invaliduri_summary=URIs must be properly escaped, they must not contain unescaped\n\
characters below U+0021 including the space character and not\n\
above U+007E. Tidy escapes the URI for you as recommended by\n\
HTML 4.01 section B.2.1 and XML 1.0 section 4.2.2. Some user agents\n\
use another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided\n\
scripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must\n\
escape the URI by your own. For more information please refer to\n\
http://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-and-ident.html\n

version_summary:Java HTML Tidy release date: {0}\n\
See http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett for details

invalid_char={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid character code {1}
invalid_utf8={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid UTF-8 bytes (char. code {1})
invalid_utf16={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid UTF-16 surrogate pair (char. code {1})
invalid_ncr={0,choice,0#replacing|1#discarding} invalid numeric character reference {1}
encoding_mismatch=specified input encoding ({0}) does not match actual input encoding ({1})
missing_semicolon_ncr=numeric character reference "{0}" doesn't end in ";"

vendor_specific_chars_summary=It is unlikely that vendor-specific, system-dependent encodings\n\
work widely enough on the World Wide Web; you should avoid using the \n\
{0,choice,0#specified|1#Windows-1252|2#MacRoman} character encoding, instead you are recommended to\n\
use named entities, e.g. &trade;.\n

invalid_sgml_chars_summary=Character codes 128 to 159 (U+0080 to U+009F) are not allowed in HTML;\n\
even if they were, they would likely be unprintable control characters.\n\
Tidy assumed you wanted to refer to a character with the same byte value in the \n\
{0,choice,0#specified|1#Windows-1252|2#MacRoman} encoding and replaced that reference with the Unicode equivalent.\n

invalid_utf8_summary=Character codes for UTF-8 must be in the range: U+0000 to U+10FFFF.\n\
The definition of UTF-8 in Annex D of ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 also\n\
allows for the use of five- and six-byte sequences to encode\n\
characters that are outside the range of the Unicode character set;\n\
those five- and six-byte sequences are illegal for the use of\n\
UTF-8 as a transformation of Unicode characters. ISO/IEC 10646\n\
does not allow mapping of unpaired surrogates, nor U+FFFE and U+FFFF\n\
(but it does allow other noncharacters). For more information please refer to\n\
http://www.unicode.org/unicode and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html\n

invalid_utf16_summary=Character codes for UTF-16 must be in the range: U+0000 to U+10FFFF.\n\
The definition of UTF-16 in Annex C of ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 does not allow the\n\
mapping of unpaired surrogates. For more information please refer to\n\
http://www.unicode.org/unicode and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html\n
