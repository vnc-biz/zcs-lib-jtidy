    <section name="About JTidy">
      <p>
        JTidy is a Java port of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</a>
        , a HTML syntax checker and pretty printer. Like its non-Java cousin, JTidy can be used as a tool for cleaning up malformed and faulty HTML. In addition, JTidy provides a DOM interface to the document that is being processed, which effectively makes you able to use JTidy as a DOM parser for real-world HTML.
      </p>
      <p>JTidy was written by Andy Quick, who later stepped down from the maintainer position. Now JTidy is maintained by a group of volunteers.</p>
