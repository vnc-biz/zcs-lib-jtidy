RELEASE NOTES FOR JTIDY

$Id$
Version: 04aug2000r6
================================================================

The 04aug2000r6 has the following changes:

- Fixed a bug in the parseAttribute() method of Lexer.java which generated an incorrect
  length for the UTF8 representation of characters above \u007f.  This was causing
  a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in method isValidAttributeName() of Lexer.java at
  line 2577.  Thanks to dlgo@users.sourceforge.net for reporting this problem.
- Fixed a bug in the insertedToken() method of Lexer.java which generated a Negative
  ArraySizeException in the clone() method of Node.java.  An ending value for a range in
  a character array was not being set correctly.  Thanks again to
  dlgo@users.sourceforge.net for reporting this problem.
- Fixed a bug in Lexer.java where a "!" was omitted from an if condition, causing 
  the reverse of expected behavior with namespaces.  Fix is attributed to Randi Waki
  <rwaki@flipdog.com>.
- dlp@users.sourceforge.net contributed a fix so that hasAttributes() in DOMNodeImpl.java
  would return the correct boolean value instead of throwing a not implemented exception.
- Added support for CDATASections in the DOM model.
- Fixed a bug in the createProps() method of Clean.java which caused a
  StringOutOfBoundsException in line 156 due to trailing spaces in a CSS property name.
- Changed the behavior of DOMNodeImpl so that nodes added via the DOM interface have
  the correct node type.  Previously, such nodes could not contain any content because
  they were added with a type of StartEndTag.
- Added methods to support DOM Level 2.
- Fixed a bug where createElement() was not properly setting Node.tag if the tag to be added
  could not be found in the the TagTable.  A generic entry is now used instead of leaving the
  entry set to null.
