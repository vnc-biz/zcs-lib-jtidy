RELEASE NOTES FOR JTIDY

$Id$
Version: 04aug2000r2
================================================================

This is the first SourceForge release of JTidy, packaged by 
Sami Lempinen (sami@lempinen.net).

Compared to the last release by Andy Quick (the original porter),
the new release has the following changes:

- The package structure has been reorganised a little. In the binary 
  release, the Java bytecode classes and the Tidy JAR can be found under
  the build/ subdirectory.
- The Ant build system is now the authoritative one. The old Makefiles
  (untouched) can be found under contrib/ should someone want to start
  maintaining them.
- A patch by Brett Knights has been incorporated. The patch affects
  the DOMNodeImpl class and ensures that CharacterData always returns
  at least an empty string (compared to null) as the value. This patch
  has not been verified with a DOM guru, so comments are welcome.

As this package is the first one after the reorganisation, there are
likely to be problems. Please report them using the SourceForge bug
tracking interface at

Enjoy!
